# task1
This is a simple project designed simply for learning purposes. The goal is to get familiar with node.js, creating API requests through express library and working with server side, storing and playing with sample products in the database (Postgres). 

There are different kind of products stored in the database. If you wish to access the product list, to view, create, edit or delete products, you can specify the endpoint "/products/(id)" in your API request to make that possible. In order to do this, however, first of all you need to register, provinding your email and password. Then, after successfully logging in, you are free to work with the products list (view, add, edit, delete).
